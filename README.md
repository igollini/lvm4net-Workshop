Material for the Sunbelt workshop on **"Exploring networks using latent variable models in R with `lvm4net`"**

Latent variable network models represent an effective and efficient approach for exploring the structure of complex relational data. In this hands-on workshop we will describe and demonstrate the modelling approaches of the `lvm4net` package for R by the analysis of real network data. This package have been developed to provide a rich source of insights on probabilistic visualisation and clustering and describing the heterogenous connectivity structure of one-mode, two-mode, and multiplex networks using fast estimation techniques (such as variational inference). 
Topics of the workshop include: 
- Introduction to latent variable network models; 
- Latent space models for one-mode, two-mode, and multiplex networks; 
- Model-based clustering for two-mode networks; 
- Probabilistic visualisation and interpretation of estimated latent variables; 
- Model selection and goodness of fit assessment.

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of network analysis, statistics and R. Participants are recommended to bring a laptop with R/RStudio, the latest version of `lvm4net` installed, and the following packages installed:
`"statnet", "latentnet", "RSiena", "sna", "manet", "sand", "colorspace"`

The package `lvm4net` is available on CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lvm4net, further information is available on http://igollini.github.io/lvm4net/.

Organiser and instructor: Isabella Gollini <isabella.gollini@ucd.ie>, Assistant Professor in Statistics, University College Dublin, Ireland.
